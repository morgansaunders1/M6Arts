        <p>My name is Morgan Saunders, the artist behind M6 Arts. The name comes from my birthday, 6/6. 6 has always been my favorite number. I am an Art Student at Arizona State University but grew up in a small rural town in Washington state. I have always been a creative and plan to expand M6 Arts to more than just prints. I have also always been an animal lover, I grew up with dogs and horses and that was something I really missed when I moved away for school. So I got involved volunteering at shelters and began fostering dogs and learning about all of the issues in animal welfare in Arizona and across the US. This really lit a fire in me to always be an advocate for animals in need in all paths in life.</p>
