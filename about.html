        <p>My name is Morgan Saunders, and I’m the artist behind M6 Arts. The name “M6” comes from my birthday, June 6th. Creativity and animals have always been central to my life, and M6 Arts combines both passions. After moving away for school, I began volunteering at shelters and fostering dogs, which ignited a lifelong commitment to animal welfare. Through my art, I aim to inspire others to support and protect animals everywhere.</p>
