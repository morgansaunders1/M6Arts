    <h2>ABOUT ME & MY MISSION</h2>
    <section class="about">
        <p>My name is Morgan Saunders, and I'm the artist behind M6 Arts. This name represents myself and my birthday 5/6. I've always been drawn to animal welfare and have a deep passion for art. I strive to combine these passions by creating art that starts conversations and supports compassion. Each piece is created with intention, often reflecting personal experience, emotion, or advocacy.</p>
